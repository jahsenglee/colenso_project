To start the project:
	cd colenso_docs/scripts
	sh start_colenso_doc.sh // starts baseX server

In a seperate window/tab:
	cd colenso_view
	node app.js

To view the website, go to localhost:3000

All scenarios for Core are done except XQuery/XPath doesn't render anything (query still works)
Editing and adding documents done on view layer, but not functional.
Gives good idea of the attempted implementation.

No video sorry, despite 2 hours of me trying, could not get it recorded.
